# Tic-Tac-Toe-Memory-version-


Welcome to the memory game!

Look away from the board and have a helper enter r
to randomize the board until they have a random board
that they like.  Then you glance at it and try to
imprint it in your mind and look away.  Your helper
will then select a single piece to be flipped by
choosing its row and column.  The changed board is then
displayed. You then must try to guess which one it was.
Enter x to exit the program.
